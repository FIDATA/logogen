Logo Generator
==============

This tool takes a source of a logo in SVG format
and produces images and auxilliary files
for a variety of target operating systems, websites and social networks.

It is implemented as a plugin
for [Gradle](https://gradle.org) build tool
and is actually a wrapper
around [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/).

The goal of this tool is to produce logos
with the least time and effort.
Its target audience includes open source projects without a budget,
and startup projects.
It can also be used to generate placeholder icons.
This tool doesn't replace a human designer
who can manually polish a logo for specific icon size
and other requirements. It is just a cheap alternative.

Usage
-----

1.  As it is a wrapper around ImageMagick,
    the latter should be installed

2.  Application and configuration of plugin:

    ```
    plugins {
      id 'org.fidata.logogen' version '0.1.0'
    }

    logogen {
      srcFile = file('src/main/svg/logo.svg')
      background = '#CCFFEE'
    }
    ```

    Both configuration options are required.

    `background` option is used in the cases
    when opaque background is required.

Custom Generators
-----------------

User can implement custom logo generator, extending
[LogoGenerator](src/main/groovy/org/fidata/logogen/generators/LogoGenerator.groovy)
class.

Custom generator could be registered in `LogoGenBasePlugin.generators`
collection, then the plugin
will create a task of this type automatically.
